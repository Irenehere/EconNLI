== Education ==
For the typical finance career path and corresponding education requirements see:
Financial analyst generally, and esp. § Qualification, discussing various investment, banking, and corporate roles (i.e. financial management, corporate finance, investment banking, securities analysis & valuation, portfolio & investment management, credit analysis, working capital & treasury management; see Financial modeling § Accounting)
Quantitative analyst, Quantitative analysis (finance) § Education and Financial engineering § Education, specifically re roles in quantitative finance (i.e. derivative pricing & hedging, interest rate modeling, financial risk management, financial engineering, computational finance; also, the mathematically intensive variant on the banking roles; see Financial modeling § Quantitative finance)
Business education lists undergraduate degrees in business, commerce, accounting and economics; "finance" may be taken as a major in most of these, whereas "quantitative finance" is almost invariably postgraduate, following a math-focused Bachelors; the most common degrees for (entry level) investment, banking, and corporate roles are:
Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)
Bachelor of Commerce (BCom)
Bachelor of Accountancy (B.Acc)
Bachelor of Economics (B.Econ)
Bachelor of Finance - the undergraduate version of the MSF below
The tagged BS / BA "in Finance", or less common, "in Investment Management" or "in Personal Finance"
At the postgraduate level, the MBA, MCom and MSM (and recently the Master of Applied Economics) similarly offer training in finance generally; at this level there are also the following specifically focused master's degrees, with MSF the broadest - see Master of Finance § Comparison with other qualifications for their focus and inter-relation:
Master of Applied Finance (M.App.Fin)
Master of Commerce (MCom)
Master of Computational Finance
Master's in Corporate Finance
Master of Finance (M.Fin, MIF)
Master's in Financial Analysis
Master of Financial Economics
Master of Financial Engineering (MFE)
Master of Financial Planning
Master's in Financial Management
Master of Financial Mathematics
Master's in Financial Risk Management
Master's in Investment Management
Master of Mathematical Finance
Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF)
Master of Science in Finance (MSF, MSc Finance)
MS in Fintech
Doctoral-training in finance is usually a requirement for academia, but not relevant to industry
quants often enter the profession with PhDs in disciplines such as physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science, and learn finance "on the job”
as an academic field, finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management, (financial) economics, accountancy, and applied / financial mathematics.
For specialized roles, there are various Professional Certifications in financial services (see #Designations and accreditation above); the best recognized are arguably:
Association of Corporate Treasurers (MCT / FCT)
Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF)
Certified Financial Planner (CFP)
Certified International Investment Analyst (CIIA)
Certified Treasury Professional (CTP)
Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA)
Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)
Chartered Wealth Manager (CWM)
CISI Diploma in Capital Markets (MCSI)
Financial Risk Manager (FRM)
Professional Risk Manager (PRM)
Various organizations offer executive education, CPD, or other focused training programs, including:
Amsterdam Institute of Finance
