Following is a partial list of professional certifications in financial services, with an overview of the educational and continuing requirements for each; 
see Professional certification § Accountancy, auditing and finance and Category:Professional certification in finance for all articles.

Note that in the US, many state securities and insurance regulators do not allow financial professionals to use a designation — in particular a "senior" designation — unless it has been accredited by either the American National Standards Institute or the National Commission for Certifying Agencies.
