== Biography ==
Stanley Fischer was born into a Jewish family in Mazabuka, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). When he was 13, his family moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he became an active member of Habonim, a Labor Zionist youth movement. In 1960, he visited Israel as part of a winter program for youth leaders, and studied Hebrew at kibbutz Ma'agan Michael. He had originally planned to study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, but instead accepted a scholarship to attend the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom, where he received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in economics between 1962 and 1966. Fischer then went on to graduate study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a Ph.D. in economics in 1969 with a thesis titled Essays on Assets and Contingent Commodities, written under the supervision of Franklin M. Fisher. He became a naturalised citizen of the United States in 1976.
Fischer was married to Rhoda Fischer (née Keet), whom he met during his days in Habonim; the couple had three children. When they moved to Israel, Rhoda became honorary president of Aleh Negev, a rehabilitation village for the disabled. Rhoda Fischer passed away in 2020.


== Academic career ==
In the early 1970s, Fischer was an associate professor at the University of Chicago. He was a professor at the Department of Economics at MIT from 1977 to 1988.
In 1977, Fischer wrote the paper Long-Term Contracts, Rational Expectations, and the Optimal Money Supply Rule, where he combined the idea of rational expectations argued by new classical economists such as Robert Lucas with the idea that price stickiness still led to some degree of market shortcomings, and so argued that an active monetary policy could help mitigate problems in times of economic downturn. The paper made Fischer a central figure in New Keynesian economics. Through this critique of new classical macroeconomics, Fischer contributed significantly to clarifying the limits of the policy-ineffectiveness proposition.He authored three popular economics textbooks, Macroeconomics (with Rüdiger Dornbusch and Richard Startz), Lectures on Macroeconomics (with Olivier Blanchard), and the introductory Economics, with David Begg and Rüdiger Dornbusch. He also mentored and helped advise the Ph.D. theses authored by economists Ben Bernanke, Mario Draghi, and Greg Mankiw.In 2012, Fischer served as Humanitas Visiting Professor in Economic Thought at the University of Oxford.

He had been involved in the past with the Bank of Israel; he had helped implement Israel’s 1985 Economic Stabilization Plan as an American government adviser. He took the position on May 1, 2005, replacing David Klein (who ended his term on January 16, 2005),   and was sworn in for a second term on May 2, 2010. Fischer became an Israeli citizen, but did not renounce U.S. citizenship.Under his management, in 2010, the Bank of Israel was ranked first among central banks for its efficient functioning, according to IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook.Fischer was widely praised for his handling of the Israeli economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; in September 2009, the Bank of Israel was the first bank in the developed world to raise interest rates.In 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Fischer received an "A" rating on the Central Banker Report Card published by Global Finance magazine.In June 2011, Fischer applied for the post of IMF managing director to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but was barred, as the IMF stipulates that a new managing director must be no older than 65, and he was 67 at the time.On June 30, 2013, Fischer stepped down as Governor of the Bank of Israel halfway through his second term, despite high popularity.
