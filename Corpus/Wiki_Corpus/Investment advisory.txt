An Investment advisory, is a service that recommends certain securities primed for appreciation, usually through direct management of clients' assets or by way of written publications.


== Purpose ==
Advisory services usually explain their investment theses to their customers and propose assets (such as stocks) that they view will appreciate over time. Advisers typically provide ongoing advice about buying, selling and/or holding investments and will monitor the performance of your investments and their alignment with the buyer's overall investment objectives.  The fee that the customer pays for this advice is typically based on the value of all of the assets held in their account with the adviser.  They may pay other fees and costs related to servicing the account and the investments that are bought or sold.  Advisers also may give advice about market trends or asset allocation or offer financial planning services. Investment advisers owe a fiduciary duty to their clients and are required to put their clientsâ€™ interests first at all times. Advisors usually suggest various potential investment strategies designed to best meet clientele  needs given their budget and preferences.
