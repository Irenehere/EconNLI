Field of science  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published.  There are many economics-related scientific journals.
Social science  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.


== Branches of economics ==
