== Political economy and economics ==


=== The Wealth of Nations ===
Adam Smith
An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776.
Read it on WikisourceDescription: The book is usually considered to be the beginning of modern economics.: 15 : 45   It begins with a discussion of the Industrial Revolution. Later it critiques the mercantilism and a synthesis of the emerging economic thinking of his time. It is best known for the idea of the invisible hand, although this idea is only mentioned once in the book.: 43, 47  Smith was critical of the "vile maxim" of the "masters of mankind", all for themselves and nothing for other people. The Butcher, the Baker, and the Brewer provide goods and services to each other out of self-interest; the unplanned result of this division of labor is a better standard of living for all three.: 48 Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence, Introduction

Das Kapital on Wikisource
Annotations, Explanations and Clarifications to Capital.Description: A political-economic treatise by Karl Marx.

Importance: Breakthrough, Influence


=== Progress and Poverty ===
Henry George
Progress and Poverty, 1879.

=== Economics ===
Paul A. Samuelson, 1948. Economics: An Introductory Analysis
_____ and William D. Nordhaus Economics, 19th ed. McGraw-Hill.Importance:: Influential multi-level, best-selling principles textbook that popularized neoclassical synthesis of Keynesian economics and neoclassical economics.


== Microeconomics ==


=== Value and Capital ===
John R. Hicks
Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1939, 1946, 2nd ed.Description: See Importance.
Importance: The book built on ordinal utility and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the substitution effect and the income effect for an individual in demand theory in the 2-good case. It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the composite good. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the aggregation problem, most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced general equilibrium theory to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.


== Macroeconomics ==
Among the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:


=== General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money ===
John Maynard Keynes, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1936Description: In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of aggregate demand to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the Great Depression. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.
Importance: Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence


=== A Monetary History of the United States ===
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1963Description: Friedman and Schwartz used changes in monetary aggregates to explain business cycle fluctuations in the United States economy.
Importance: Influence


== Game theory ==


=== Theory of Games and Economic Behavior ===
John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern
Princeton University Press, 1944Description: The book by the mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern. It contained a mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.
This is now a classic work, upon which modern-day game theory is based. Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. It is today established, both throughout the social sciences and in a wide range of other sciences.
Importance: Topic creator, Influence


== Mathematical economics ==


=== Foundations of Economic Analysis ===
Paul A. Samuelson
Harvard University Press (1947, Enlarged ed. 1983)The book showed how operationally meaningful theorems can be described with a small number of analogous methods, thus providing "a general theory of economic theories."  It moved mathematics out of the appendices (as in John R. Hicks's Value and Capital) and helped change how standard economic analysis across subjects could be done with the same mathematical methods.
Importance and Influence: Accelerated change in standard methods
