Investopedia was founded in 1999 by Cory Wagner and Cory Janssen in Edmonton, Alberta. At the time, Janssen was a business student at the University of Alberta. Wagner focused on business development and research and development, while Janssen focused on marketing and sales.

In April 2007, Forbes Media acquired Investopedia.com for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the acquisition, Investopedia drew about 2,500,000 monthly users and provided a financial dictionary with about 5,000 terms from personal finance, banking and accounting. It also provided articles by financial advisers and a stock market simulator.


=== 2010s ===
In August 2010, Forbes sold Investopedia to ValueClick for $42 million. By then, the site had grown to more than 30,000 pieces of content and reached 2.2 million unique visitors per month. In 2013, ValueClick would then sell Investopedia and a group of other properties to IAC for $80 million. Following the acquisition by IAC, Investopedia launched several initiatives, including Investopedia Academy to sell educational technology.In March 2015, David Siegel, an alum of Seeking Alpha, was hired as CEO of Investopedia. Caleb Silver was hired from CNN to oversee content operations for the platform in January 2016.

The site underwent a rebranding and relaunch later in the year. In early 2019, the site announced the winners of its inaugural online broker and robo-advisor awards.


=== 2020s ===
In 2020, editor-in-chief Silver described Investopedia's goal as "provid[ing] context around the news," rather than breaking new stories. The site launched its first podcast, The Investopedia Express, hosted by Silver, in September 2020.Silver also frequently appears as a guest financial expert on a variety of broadcast and radio programs, including MSNBC, ABC News and NBC.
